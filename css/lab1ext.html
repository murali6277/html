        <p>Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency
            as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment.
            After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October
            2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the
            club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of
            the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008â€“09
            season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi
            won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins</p>
